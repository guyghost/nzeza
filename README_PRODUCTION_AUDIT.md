### 🔒 For Security Lead
**Security status:** 50/100 (framework ready, not verified)

Read:
1. `docs/PRIORITY_FIXES.md` - What's been implemented
2. `docs/SECURITY.md` - Security guidelines
3. `PRODUCTION_STATUS.md` → Security section

**Critical actions:**
- [ ] External security audit (before production)
- [ ] Verify 1Password CLI integration

## Production Readiness Scorecard

| Component | Score | Status | Critical? |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Domain Layer | 100% | ✅ Ready | - |
| WebSocket | 0% | ❌ Missing | 🔴 YES |
| Exchange Integration | 30% | ⚠️ Partial | 🔴 YES |
| Signal Generation | 0% | ❌ Missing | 🔴 YES |
| Security | 50% | ⚠️ Partial | 🟡 MAYBE |
| Operations | 0% | ❌ Missing | 🟡 YES |
| Deployment | 0% | ❌ Missing | 🟡 YES |

**Overall: 45/100 - NOT READY**

## Critical Blockers

### 🔴 Blocker #1: Phase 5.1 WebSocket
- **Impact:** System cannot fetch prices → cannot trade
- **Status:** 20 tests written (RED), implementation pending
- **Fix:** 3-5 days implementation work
- **Owner:** Next developer (see PHASE_5_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

### 🔴 Blocker #2: dYdX Integration Broken
- **Impact:** Orders will be rejected
- **Status:** Wrong signing mechanism (Ethereum vs Cosmos)
- **Options:** Fix (5 days) or drop (immediate)
- **Recommendation:** Start with Coinbase-only

### 🔴 Blocker #3: No Production Testing
- **Impact:** Unknown behavior at scale
- **Status:** Phase 6 not started
- **Fix:** 1-2 weeks load/stress testing
- **Critical:** Before any production deployment

---

## Realistic Timeline to Production

```
Week 1:  Phase 5.1 (WebSocket) → 20 tests green ✅
Week 2:  Phase 5.2-5.4 (Integration) → Full flow working ✅
Week 3:  Phase 6 (Validation) → Load testing done ✅
Week 4:  Infrastructure → Docker/K8s/monitoring ready ✅
Week 5-6: Dry-runs → Verified on testnet/mainnet
Week 7-8: Buffer → Production deployment
────────────────────────────────────
Total: 6-8 weeks (optimistic)
Realistic: 10-12 weeks (with setbacks)
Side-project: 3-4 months
```

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ CONTINUE Development
- Excellent foundation (TDD, DDD, domain layer)
- Clear path forward (Phase 5.1-7 defined)
- Achievable timeline (6-8 weeks with team)

### ⛔ DO NOT Deploy Today
- Phase 5.1 not implemented (price feeds missing)
- Production testing incomplete (Phase 6)
- Security not externally verified

### 🎯 Immediate Actions
1. Assign Phase 5.1 implementer
2. Decide on dYdX support (fix or drop)
3. Setup GitHub Actions CI/CD
4. Plan security audit

## Current Progress

```
✅ Phase 1: RED (Tests written)           COMPLETE
✅ Phase 2: GREEN (Implementation)        COMPLETE
✅ Phase 3: Fixes                         COMPLETE
✅ Phase 4: Domain refactoring            COMPLETE (129/129 tests passing)
⏳ Phase 5: Integration testing           IN PROGRESS (0% of Phase 5.1)
❌ Phase 6: Production validation         NOT STARTED
❌ Phase 7: Deployment/Operations         NOT STARTED

Domain Layer:  100% ✅

## For Quick Decision-Making

### Q: Can we deploy now?
**A:** No. Phase 5.1 (WebSocket) not implemented.

### Q: When can we deploy?
**A:** 6-8 weeks (with dedicated team) if Phase 5 is implemented immediately.

### Q: What's the biggest risk?
**A:** Phase 5.1 underestimated or delayed → cascades through Phase 5.2-7.

### Q: What's working well?
**A:** Domain layer (129 tests passing), architecture (TDD/DDD), error handling.

### Q: Should we continue?
**A:** Yes - clear path, excellent foundation, achievable timeline.
