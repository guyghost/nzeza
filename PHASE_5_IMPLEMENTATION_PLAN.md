```

### How to Verify

```bash

$ cargo test websocket --lib
test result: ok. 31 passed (or more)

# Full verification:
$ cargo test --lib
$ cargo clippy --lib
$ cargo fmt -- --check
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Tests too complex | Keep tests small, one behavior each |
| Mocking overhead | Use manual mocks (simpler than frameworks) |
| Flaky tests | All deterministic, no real timing |
| Domain regression | No changes to existing code |
| Scope creep | Stick to specified phases |
| Integration problems | Use clear contracts between modules |
