## Feature Details: Portfolio Reconciliation Service

### Core Functionality
```
What: Detect discrepancies between local portfolio state and exchange balances
Why: Essential safety feature, prevents over-leveraging, ensures data integrity
How: 
  1. Fetch real balances from exchange APIs
  2. Compare with local Position/Portfolio state
  3. Detect and classify discrepancies
  4. Create audit trail
  5. Trigger recovery logic if needed
```

### Key Components
1. **PortfolioReconciliationService** (trait) - Core logic
2. **ReconciliationActor** - Async orchestration
3. **ExchangeReconcilers** - Per-exchange implementations
4. **ReconciliationRepository** - Audit trail persistence
5. **Configuration** - Environment-based setup

### Test Coverage Target
- **Balance Fetching Tests:** 5 tests
- **Discrepancy Detection:** 5 tests
- **Reconciliation Logic:** 5 tests
- **Error Handling:** 5 tests
- **Actor & Integration:** 3 tests
- **Total:** 23 tests (15-20 minimum)

### Implementation Timeline
| Phase | Task | Duration | Status |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| Planning | Create proposal + design | 30 mins | ✅ DONE |
| RED | Write tests (test-writer agent) | 45 mins | ⏳ READY |
| GREEN | Implement code (implementer agent) | 90 mins | ⏳ READY |
| REFACTOR | Optimize + commit (reviewer agent) | 30 mins | ⏳ READY |
| Archive | Document and archive change | 15 mins | ⏳ READY |
| **TOTAL** | | **3-4 hours** | ✅ READY |

## OpenCode Workflow Ready

### Phase 1: RED - Failing Tests ✅ READY
```bash
Task(
  description="Write failing tests for portfolio reconciliation",
  prompt="Create comprehensive test suite for portfolio reconciliation service that fails because implementation doesn't exist yet. Include tests for: balance fetching, discrepancy detection, reconciliation logic, error handling, and actor integration.",
  subagent_type="test-writer"
)
```

### Phase 2: GREEN - Implementation ✅ READY
```bash
Task(
  description="Implement portfolio reconciliation service",
  prompt="Write minimal implementation code to make all portfolio reconciliation tests pass. Include: PortfolioReconciliationService trait, exchange-specific reconcilers, ReconciliationActor, ReconciliationRepository, configuration parameters.",
  subagent_type="implementer"
)
```

### Phase 3: REFACTOR - Optimization ✅ READY
```bash
Task(
  description="Review and commit portfolio reconciliation feature",
  prompt="Optimize code while keeping tests green. Run cargo fmt, cargo clippy, ensure all tests pass. Create conventional commit with proper format explaining business value and implementation details.",
  subagent_type="reviewer"
)
```

## Git Workflow Prepared

### Branch Strategy (Trunk-Based Development)
```bash
# Start feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/portfolio-reconciliation

# RED phase
git commit -m "test(reconciliation): add failing tests for portfolio reconciliation"

# GREEN phase
git commit -m "feat(reconciliation): implement portfolio reconciliation service"

# REFACTOR phase
git commit -m "refactor(reconciliation): optimize performance and add documentation"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feat/portfolio-reconciliation
git push origin main

# Archive
openspec archive add-portfolio-reconciliation --yes
```

## Success Metrics

✅ **All tests passing** (15-20 tests, 100% success rate)  
✅ **Code quality** (cargo fmt passes, no clippy warnings)  
✅ **Documentation** (API docs, examples, configuration)  
✅ **Conventional commit** (proper format with business value)  
✅ **Feature merged** (integrated to main branch)  
✅ **Change archived** (recorded in openspec)  

## Current Project Status

| Layer | Status | Score | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| Domain | ✅ READY | 100% | 129/129 tests passing |
| Symbol Screening | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% | 21 tests, fully functional |
| Portfolio Reconciliation | ⏳ READY | 0% | Proposal complete, ready for TDD |
| Overall Production Readiness | ⚠️ | 45% | After this feature: 50-55% |
