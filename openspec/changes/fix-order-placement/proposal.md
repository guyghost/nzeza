# Fix Order Placement Execution

## Why
The system generates trading signals but fails to execute orders, resulting in missed trading opportunities and user frustration. This breaks the core value proposition of automated trading.

## What Changes
This change adds comprehensive diagnostics and fixes for the order execution pipeline:

- Enhanced logging throughout the execution path to identify failures
- Validation of signal storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Trader availability and health monitoring
- Improved error reporting with actionable context
- Execution performance metrics and alerting

## Problem
The system generates trading signals but no orders are being executed. Users see signals in logs but no trades occur.

## Root Cause Analysis
After code review, the issue stems from multiple potential failure points in the order execution pipeline:

1. **Signal Storage**: Signals are generated but may not be stored in the LRU cache for execution
2. **Candle Collection**: Insufficient candles prevent signal generation (requires MIN_CANDLES_FOR_SIGNAL = 5)
3. **Trader Availability**: No traders available to execute orders
4. **Configuration Issues**: Automated trading disabled or confidence thresholds too high
5. **Position Limits**: Maximum positions reached preventing new orders

## Proposed Solution
Implement comprehensive diagnostics and fixes for the order execution pipeline:

- Add detailed logging throughout the execution path
- Ensure signals are properly stored after generation
- Validate trader initialization and availability
- Add health checks for order execution components
- Improve error reporting for failed executions

## Impact
- Orders will execute when signals meet criteria
- Better visibility into execution failures
- Improved system reliability for trading operations

## Risk Assessment
- Low risk: Changes are primarily diagnostic and logging improvements
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible with current configuration
