# Proposal: Add Portfolio Reconciliation Service

**Change ID:** `add-portfolio-reconciliation`  
**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Author:** Claude (AI Assistant)  
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Scope:** New Feature  

## Executive Summary

Implement a comprehensive **Portfolio Reconciliation Service** that detects and handles discrepancies between local portfolio state and actual exchange balances. This is a critical safety feature that prevents over-leveraging, identifies trading anomalies, and ensures data integrity.

## Business Value

### Problems Solved
1. **Exchange Desynchronization Risk:** Detects when local state diverges from exchange reality
2. **Over-Leveraging Prevention:** Catches cases where funds are tied up unexpectedly
3. **Operational Safety:** Provides audit trail and alerts for compliance
4. **Data Integrity:** Ensures portfolio calculations are based on accurate balances

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Reconciliation accuracy: 100% match with exchange balances
- ✅ Detection latency: < 5 seconds after discrepancy occurs
- ✅ Audit trail completeness: All reconciliation events logged
- ✅ Recovery success rate: Automatically resolve 90%+ of issues

### User Impact
- Traders get real-time confidence in portfolio accuracy
- System automatically recovers from network desynchronization
- Operational team has full audit trail for compliance

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Balance Fetching**
- Fetch current balances from all configured exchanges
- Support multiple currencies (BTC, ETH, USDC, etc.)
- Handle exchange-specific API differences
- Implement exponential backoff for transient failures

**FR-2: Reconciliation Logic**
- Compare fetched balances with local state
- Calculate discrepancies per currency
- Determine severity level (info, warning, error)
- Generate reconciliation report

**FR-3: Discrepancy Detection**
- Detect missing currencies
- Detect balance mismatches > threshold
- Detect precision/rounding errors
- Detect timing-related inconsistencies

**FR-4: Recovery Actions**
- Auto-sync local state when discrepancy found
- Create reconciliation events in audit log
- Trigger alerts for operational team
- Support manual override if needed

**FR-5: Audit Trail**
- Log all reconciliation attempts
- Record before/after states
- Track resolution actions
- Maintain compliance records

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-1: Performance**
- Reconciliation should not block trading
- Average reconciliation time: < 500ms per exchange
- Memory overhead: < 10MB per exchange
- Support 5+ concurrent reconciliations

**NFR-2: Reliability**
- No data loss on service restart
- Graceful degradation if exchange APIs fail
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker for cascading failures

**NFR-3: Security**
- No exposure of sensitive balance data in logs
- API credentials isolated per exchange
- Audit trail tamper-evident (immutable records)
- Compliance with exchange API security requirements

**NFR-4: Maintainability**
- Clear separation between balance fetching and reconciliation logic
- Extensible design for new exchanges
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Clear documentation with examples

## Architecture Design

### Core Components

```
PortfolioReconciliationService (trait)
├── ExchangeSpecificImpl (DydxReconciler, CoinbaseReconciler, etc.)
├── PortfolioReconciliationActor
├── ReconciliationRepository
└── ReconciliationConfig
```

### Data Structures

```rust
pub struct Balance {
    pub currency: String,
    pub total: f64,
    pub available: f64,
    pub locked: f64,
}

pub struct ReconciliationReport {
    pub exchange: Exchange,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub local_balances: Vec<Balance>,
    pub exchange_balances: Vec<Balance>,
    pub discrepancies: Vec<BalanceDiscrepancy>,
    pub status: ReconciliationStatus,
}

pub enum BalanceDiscrepancy {
    Missing { currency: String, amount: f64 },
    Mismatch { currency: String, local: f64, exchange: f64, diff: f64 },
    Precision { currency: String, tolerance: f64 },
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **Position Manager:** Gets local position data
2. **Portfolio Manager:** Updates global state if needed
3. **Exchange Clients:** Fetches real balances
4. **Repository Layer:** Stores audit trail
5. **Configuration:** Gets reconciliation parameters

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Design & Test Plan
- [ ] Create trait definitions
- [ ] Design audit trail schema
- [ ] Plan test scenarios (15-20 tests)

### Phase 2: RED - Write Failing Tests (test-writer agent)
- [ ] Test balance fetching
- [ ] Test discrepancy detection
- [ ] Test reconciliation logic
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test edge cases

### Phase 3: GREEN - Implement Code (implementer agent)
- [ ] Implement PortfolioReconciliationService trait
- [ ] Implement exchange-specific reconcilers
- [ ] Implement ReconciliationActor
- [ ] Implement ReconciliationRepository
- [ ] Add configuration parameters

### Phase 4: REFACTOR - Optimize & Commit (reviewer agent)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Code cleanup and documentation
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Create conventional commit

### Phase 5: Archive & Deploy
- [ ] Archive change in openspec/changes/archive/
- [ ] Merge to main branch
- [ ] Validate production readiness

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```
RECONCILIATION_ENABLED=true
RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_SECONDS=300
RECONCILIATION_THRESHOLD_USD=10.0
RECONCILIATION_RETRY_COUNT=3
RECONCILIATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

### Implementation Details
Will extend `TradingConfig` struct with:
```rust
pub reconciliation_enabled: bool,
pub reconciliation_interval_seconds: u64,
pub reconciliation_threshold_usd: f64,
pub reconciliation_retry_count: u32,
pub reconciliation_timeout_seconds: u64,
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories

**1. Unit Tests (5-6 tests)**
- Balance comparison logic
- Discrepancy detection algorithm
- Precision/rounding handling

**2. Integration Tests (5-7 tests)**
- Multi-exchange reconciliation
- Actor message handling
- Repository persistence

**3. Error Handling Tests (3-4 tests)**
- Exchange API failures
- Network timeouts
- Invalid balance data

**4. Edge Cases (2-3 tests)**
- Empty balances
- Zero-value balances
- Concurrent reconciliations

**Total: 15-20 tests with 100% pass target**

## Risk Assessment

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Exchange API failures | Medium | Low | Exponential backoff + circuit breaker |
| Data consistency issues | Low | High | Comprehensive audit trail |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Separate async task, monitoring |
| Incorrect reconciliation | Very Low | High | Extensive testing + manual override |

## Success Criteria

✅ All 15-20 tests passing with 100% success rate  
✅ Code properly formatted (`cargo fmt --check` passes)  
✅ No new clippy warnings on new code  
✅ API documentation complete with examples  
✅ Conventional commit created with proper format  
✅ Feature branch merged to main  
✅ Change archived in openspec/changes/archive/  

## Effort Estimate

| Task | Duration |
|------|----------|
| Proposal & Design | 30 mins |
| RED Phase (test-writer) | 45 mins |
| GREEN Phase (implementer) | 90 mins |
| REFACTOR Phase (reviewer) | 30 mins |
| Archive & Document | 15 mins |
| **Total** | **3-4 hours** |

## Dependencies

- All required services already exist
- Repository pattern established
- Configuration system in place
- Actor model ready

### Optional Integrations

- Grafana dashboard (can be added later)

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Approach A: Simple Balance Check (Rejected)
- Pros: Simpler implementation
- Cons: No audit trail, no recovery logic
- Decision: Rejected - insufficient for production

### Approach B: Manual Reconciliation Only (Rejected)
- Pros: Less complex
- Cons: Misses automated detection
- Decision: Rejected - need automatic detection

### Approach C: Full Reconciliation (Selected)
- Pros: Complete safety, audit trail, auto-recovery
- Cons: More complex implementation
- Decision: Selected - best business value
