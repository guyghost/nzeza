# WebSocket Price Feeds - Capability Specification

**Capability ID**: `websocket-price-feeds`  
**Phase**: 5.1 - Integration Testing  
**Status**: PROPOSED

## Overview

Real-time market data ingestion via WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection, circuit breaker protection, and robust error handling.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: WebSocket Connection Management

The system SHALL:
- Accept WebSocket connection parameters (URL, symbols, timeout)
- Establish connection within 5 seconds
- Validate connection is alive via heartbeat
- Implement exponential backoff for reconnection (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- Circuit break after 5 consecutive failures
- Recover from circuit broken state after 30 seconds
- Clean up resources on graceful shutdown

#### Scenario: Connection Establishment
```
Given: WebSocket server available on tcp://localhost:9000
When: Client connects to websocket://localhost:9000
Then: Connection established within 5 seconds
And: First heartbeat received within 1 second
And: Status reports "CONNECTED"
```

#### Scenario: Reconnection with Backoff
```
Given: WebSocket connection lost
When: Reconnection attempted
Then: First retry after 1 second
And: Second retry after 2 seconds (if first fails)
And: Third retry after 4 seconds (if second fails)
And: Fourth retry after 8 seconds (if third fails)
And: Circuit opens after 5 consecutive failures
```

### Requirement: Price Data Parsing

The system SHALL:
- Parse incoming WebSocket frames as JSON
- Extract symbol, price, timestamp from frames
- Validate price is positive number
- Validate timestamp is recent (within 5 seconds)
- Handle partial frames with buffering
- Reject malformed messages with logging

#### Scenario: Valid Price Message
```
Given: WebSocket connection established
When: Receive message: {"symbol":"BTC-USD","price":45000.50,"ts":1730123456}
Then: Price object created with values
And: Symbol = "BTC-USD"
And: Price = 45000.50
And: Message delivered to subscribers
```

#### Scenario: Invalid Message Handling
```
Given: WebSocket connection established
When: Receive message: {"symbol":"BTC-USD"} (missing price)
Then: Message rejected
And: Error logged with message content
And: Connection remains open
And: Next valid message processed normally
```

### Requirement: Circuit Breaker Protection

The system SHALL:
- Track consecutive connection failures
- Open circuit after 5 failures
- Reject new connection attempts while open
- Attempt recovery after 30 seconds
- Close circuit on successful connection
- Track circuit state transitions

#### Scenario: Circuit Opens After Failures
```
Given: 5 consecutive connection failures
When: Attempting 6th connection
Then: Circuit breaker rejects attempt immediately
And: Status reports "CIRCUIT_OPEN"
And: Error indicates circuit is open
```

#### Scenario: Circuit Recovery
```
Given: Circuit open for 30 seconds
When: 30 seconds elapse
Then: Circuit attempts reset
And: If connection succeeds, circuit closes
And: Status reports "CONNECTED"
```
