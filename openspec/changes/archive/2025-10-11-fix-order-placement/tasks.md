# Tasks for Fix Order Placement Execution

## Investigation Phase
1. **Add execution diagnostics logging** - Add detailed logging in `check_and_execute_orders` to show:
   - Number of signals retrieved
   - Signal details (symbol, signal type, confidence)
   - Execution attempts and results
   - Error messages for failed executions

2. **Verify signal storage** - Ensure signals are properly stored in LRU cache:
   - Check `store_signal` calls in `signal_generation_task`
   - Verify `get_all_last_signals` returns expected signals
   - Add logging for signal storage operations

3. **Check candle collection** - Validate candle data availability:
   - Log candle counts per symbol in `generate_signal_for_symbol`
   - Ensure candle builder is properly initialized
   - Verify price updates are reaching candle builder

4. **Validate trader setup** - Confirm traders are available:
   - Log trader initialization in `main.rs`
   - Check `select_trader_sender` returns valid traders
   - Verify exchange client configuration

## Implementation Phase
5. **Fix signal storage timing** - Ensure signals are stored immediately after generation:
   - Move `store_signal` call right after successful signal generation
   - Add error handling for signal storage failures

6. **Improve confidence threshold handling** - Make confidence checks more visible:
   - Log confidence values in execution attempts
   - Add configuration validation for confidence thresholds
   - Consider dynamic threshold adjustment

7. **Add execution health checks** - Implement monitoring for order execution:
   - Track execution success/failure rates
   - Add alerts for execution failures
   - Include execution status in system health metrics

8. **Enhance error reporting** - Improve error messages and logging:
   - Add context to execution errors (signal details, trader info)
   - Log position limit checks and results
   - Include trading limit validation details

## Testing Phase
9. **Add integration tests** - Test end-to-end order execution:
   - Mock signal generation and verify execution
   - Test trader availability scenarios
   - Validate error handling paths

10. **Performance validation** - Ensure fixes don't impact performance:
    - Monitor execution latency
    - Verify no memory leaks in signal storage
    - Check system resource usage

## Deployment Phase
11. **Gradual rollout** - Deploy with monitoring:
    - Enable detailed logging initially
    - Monitor execution rates and success
    - Roll back if issues detected

12. **Documentation update** - Update troubleshooting guides:
    - Add section on diagnosing execution issues
    - Document new logging for debugging
    - Include common failure scenarios and solutions
