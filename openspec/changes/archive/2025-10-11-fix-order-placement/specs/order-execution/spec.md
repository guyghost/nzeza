# Order Execution Capability

## ADDED Requirements

### Signal to Order Conversion
The system SHALL convert trading signals with sufficient confidence into orders when automated trading is enabled.

#### Scenario: System receives trading signal with sufficient confidence
- **Given** a trading signal with confidence >= min_confidence_threshold
- **And** automated trading is enabled
- **And** trading limits are not exceeded
- **And** position limits are not exceeded
- **And** at least one trader is available
- **When** order execution task runs
- **Then** an order SHALL be placed on the appropriate exchange
- **And** the order ID SHALL be logged
- **And** position SHALL be tracked

### Execution Diagnostics
The system SHALL provide comprehensive logging throughout the order execution pipeline to identify and diagnose failures.

#### Scenario: Order execution failure occurs
- **Given** an order execution attempt fails
- **When** the failure is detected
- **Then** detailed error context SHALL be logged including signal confidence, trader status, and failure reason

### Signal Storage Validation
The system SHALL ensure trading signals are properly stored in the LRU cache immediately after generation for automated execution.

#### Scenario: Signal generation completes
- **Given** a trading signal is successfully generated
- **When** signal generation completes
- **Then** the signal SHALL be stored in the LRU cache
- **And** storage confirmation SHALL be logged

### Trader Availability Monitoring
The system SHALL validate trader availability before attempting order execution and provide clear feedback when no traders are available.

#### Scenario: No traders available for execution
- **Given** order execution is attempted
- **And** no traders are available
- **When** trader selection is attempted
- **Then** a clear error message SHALL be logged indicating no traders are available
- **And** automated trading SHALL be disabled until traders are available

### Execution Health Checks
The system SHALL monitor order execution success rates and alert when failure rates exceed acceptable thresholds.

#### Scenario: High execution failure rate detected
- **Given** order execution attempts are made
- **When** failure rate exceeds 50% over a period
- **Then** a warning SHALL be logged
- **And** system health SHALL be marked as degraded
